quotes:
 - | God is the missionary at the heart of Christian mission — that is the central insight of scripture. Although the Catechsim talks about the mission of the church, our starting place needs to be the mission of God. Mission is not fundamentally something we do as Christians but a quality of God's own being. It is not a program of ours but the path of God's action in the world. The mission of the church, therefore, derives from the mission of God, and it has meaning only in relation to what God is up to in the universe. Already engaged in mission, God simply invites us to participate in what God is doing.

 - | I suggest that God's central intention was to create a _community of life_.

 - | Surely, if God could entrust all to Abraham — and to us — we should be able to entrust one another with the mission we have received.

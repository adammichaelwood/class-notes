The Glorious Revolution...

 - The strictest Anglican left, in allegiance to old King
 - those who are left are those who are willing and able to "compromise with reality"

Sometimes, the choice is between:

 - Leaving
 - Putting up with things you find unacceptable

Out of the movement to conform to reality comes the Latitudinarians --- they want a more tolerant church.

 - Be reasonable.
 - "Christianity not Mysterious."
 - Philosophical Deism
 - Thomas Jefferson

This is going on at the same time as a scientific revolution and the Enlightenment (1700s).

A lot of CofE clergy are involved with the Royal Society.

This creates a church that is conservative, reasonable, orderly, comfortable with the _status quo_.

It is into this church that the Wesley's grow up.

John and Charles, George Whitfield, at Oxford, form the "Holy Club." Their fellow ordinands called them "Methodists."

They had a powerful religious experience that changed their lives and changed their behavior.

(At same time, the Pietism movement in Lutheranism is happening. Also the Moravian brethren. Roman Catholic devotion to the Sacred Heart. __AW:__ Also Romanticism.)

Wesleys had a passion for including those who had been excluded from the church, especially the poor.

Open air preaching. Non-litugical services. This was _against the rules._

_Imagine being a local pastor, and Wesley comes to town._

JK: I like to think that the Wesleys understood Methodism as a movement within the Church.

What did Methodism offer:

 - Spirituality
 - Lay empowerment
 - Bible study

John Wesley became convinced that if you work hard enough, pray hard enough, open enough, you can achieve moral and spiritual Perfection.

 > "Be ye perfect, as my Father in heaven is Perfect." --- Matthew

cf. [Christian Perfection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_perfection#Wesley.27s_teaching)

Also, he believe that we can experience the presence of the Holy Spirit, which leads to a change in behavior and a commitment to change society.

This shifts the purpose of worship from Praise to God, to preaching with the goal of inducing religious experience.

In the 18th c. the Wesleyan movement spreads into Anglicanism.

After the U.S. revolution, with no clear indication of whether there would be an Anglican church in the U.S., John "ordained" a superintendent and two presbyters.

In the late 18th c., Anglicans in power became involved in the Evangelical movement.

 - Holy Trinity Parish in Clapham (the "Clapham sect") was the center of Anglican Evangelicalism.
    - Hannah More
 - They took abolition as a major cause
 - __JK:__ Watch movie "Amazing Grace"
 - Evangelicals came to believe that the slave trade was fundamentally incongruent with Christianity.

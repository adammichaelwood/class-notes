There were always people in England who thought the Reformation did not go far enough.

 - Signs of the cross
 - Wedding rings
 - Theater
 - Sports
 - Gambling
 - Ale house
 - Christmas

Hooker relied on tradition and reason. Puritans said that tradition was just Roman Catholic superstition, and reason was wholly corrupt.

For Hooker, the Church is the whole nation. For Calvinists, the Church is only the "invisible Church," or the Elect.

Puritans wanted to get rid of Bishops. The King's duty is to impose the Church's morality on society.

James I says that passive obedience is an obligation of Christian faith. Puritans said that if the monarch is not carrying out Christian principles, it is the duty of Christians to rebel.

Puritans thought that James I, from Scotland, would bring Calvinist reforms. They were wrong.

James I --- 1611 --- King James Bible.  

Charles I promulgates Divine Right of Kings.

ABC Laud is a High Church Bishop.

 - Move tables back to altar location.
 - Install altar rails.
 - Imposes new liturgy on Church of Scotland. 

Armed uprisings. Civil war ensues.

 - Laud is burned at the stake.
 - Charles is beheaded.
 - Cromwell comes to power.
 - Bishops go into exile.
 - BCP is outlawed.

After Commonwealth collapses under Cromwell's son, the army recalls Parliament. They vote to restore the monarchy and Charles II returns to throne. Bishops come back.

What do you do with all the Calvinist clergy in parishes all over?

 - Parliament decides
    - clergy must be (re-)ordained by Bishop
    - 5-mile act --- deposed clergy could not live within 5 miles of former parish
    - Conventicle Act --- no gatherings of more than 5 people without BCP
    - Test Act --- can not function in English society


## Restoration

James II was Catholic. When his Queen had a child, Civil War was near.

James II left England for France.

Parliament declares that the King has abdicated. They invite William and Mary to become King and Queen. (The Glorious Revolution.)

ABC, several bishops, and many clergy and lay people protests, because they had sworn allegiance to James II. --- Non-jurors.

William and Mary accept constitutional monarchy.

Church of Scotland becomes presbyterian. All the Bishops become non-jurors, along with many clergy and lay people --- the Episcopal Church of Scotland. ECS not in communion with CofE.

Non-jurors are creating a new understanding for Anglicanism, one based on theology and ecclesiology.

Queen Anne --- good solid Anglican. Act of Union brought Scotland and England together into the UK.

## Colonies

England colonies establishes colonies up and down the Eastern seaboard, and Caribbean islands.

English colonies very different from Spanish or French colonies:

 - lots of English settlers
 - French and Spanish send missionaries and soldiers

English colonies had lots of people, many dissenters and non-conformists.

Different areas got different religious demographics.

 - New England --- Puritans 
 - Penn --- Quakers
 - Maryland --- Catholics
 - Virginia and NYC --- Anglicans

CofE never sent a Bishop to the N. American colonies.

Many of the priests who came to N. America were "misfits" who couldn't get a job in England.

New clergy from N. America had to go to England to get ordained --- 50% mortality rate.

Lack of education for clergy.

 - Thomas Bray founded SPCK Society for the Preservation of Christian Knowledge
 - Society for the Propagation of the Gospel sends missionary priests to the New World.
 - Neither of these were official agencies of the Church.

### Great Awakening

Movement of non-intellectual, personal-relationship spirituality.

Decimated the organized religions that depended on educated clergy.

### Revolution

By end of 18th century, colonies had a non-English identity.

 - Declare Independence

What happens to Anglican clergy, who have sworn allegiance to the King?
 - 50% left

Most people didn't go to church. Those who did, many didn't want to go to the English church.

US sends Seabury to Scotland for Ordination

 - no lay people in power
 - Scottish Eucharistic Prayer

Parliament passes act that allows CofE to consecrate Bishops for non-English territories.

First American consecration --- Clagett, 1790 --- at Trinity Wall Street.

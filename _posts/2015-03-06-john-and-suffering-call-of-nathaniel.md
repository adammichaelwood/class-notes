## Prelude: Naked Before God

First person narrative of Call of Nathaniel, from POV of N.

## Jewish Festivals in John: Allusions in John's Prologue

### Jewish Feast of the Dedication

> What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. The light...
> --- JN 1:4-5,9

 - Chanukkah: Feast of the Dedication
 - Maccabees revolt against Antiochus
    - A had sacrificed pig in temple
 - In 165 BCE, the Jews reconsecrate the temple that had been defiled by idolatry
    - Judas Maccabeus (the Hammer)
    - Oil lasted for 8 days
    - Feast of Dedication celebrated in the month of Kislev, in the dead of winter and darkness.

### Feast of Booths (Sukkot)

> And the Word became flesh and lived among us.
> --- Jn 1:14

 - "dwelt among us" --- "fixed his booth"
 - Commemorates desert wandering after Sinai
 - Harvest Festival celebrated on 15 Tishrei
 - Focus on fragility of human life
 - Jews build a sukkah, where they live, eat, sleep and read Qoheleth (Ecclesiastes) for 7 days
 - Joy, pray for rain, waving the Lulav

> 33 The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: 34 Speak to the people of Israel, saying: On the fifteenth day of this seventh month, and lasting seven days, there shall be the festival of booths[e] to the Lord. 35 The first day shall be a holy convocation; you shall not work at your occupations. 36 Seven days you shall present the Lord’s offerings by fire; on the eighth day you shall observe a holy convocation and present the Lord’s offerings by fire; it is a solemn assembly; you shall not work at your occupations.
> --- Leviticus 23

 - In 2nd T J, there was a procession from the spring of Gihon  to the Temple area, where the water was poured on the altar.

 - On the first day of the feast, golden candlestics were lit in the the Temple Court of the Women, through which the water procession passed.

> Out of the Beleivers hear shall flow rivers of living water.
> --- Jn 7:38

> I am the Light of the World
> --- Jn 8:12

### Feast of Weeks

> The law indeed was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
> --- Jn 1:17

 - Shavuot calebrates God giving Torah through Moses to the Jewish people

 (Book: Girl Meets God)

 - Jews stay up all night studying Torah
 - The Greek name for Shavuot is Pentecost
 - Shavuot is celebrated 50 days (7 weeks and a day) after Passover

### Passover (Pesach)

 - Sukkot, Shavuot, and Pesach are the Shalosh Regalim --- the three great Jewish Festivals requiring pilgrimage to Temple.
 - Is Pesach referenced in Prologue? in John 1?

> The Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the World.
> --- Jn 1:29

> Look, here is the Lamb of God.


- God "passing over" the houses of Israel when slaying the first-born of Egypt
- The blood marks the houses of those who will not die

- How can we interpret the Lamb and the Angel of Death in light of Mimetic Theory?

- Midrash: The first-born were killing their parents.
- Lamb was Egyptian God

- Plagues indicate extreme societal breakdown.
- Perhaps the lamb is a replacement for human sacrifice among Jews. The Egyptians were killing first born.

> __Q__: Do Jews believe in miracles?
> Sure.

 - Jesus is crucified as the Pesach lambs are being slaughtered. He receives wine on a bunch of hyssop.
 - After being identified as the Logos, he is identified as the lamb who takes away the sin of the world.
 - Jesus's first question to his disciple and to the reader: What do you seek?

> __Q__: Sin vs. sins.
> Perhaps the singular sin that causes all sins.

## Sidebar

 - nietzsche --- Christians mask their cowardice with piety
 - Gandhi --- does not want coward pacifists
 
 - The SIN is rivalry. To be like God by displacing God. AS OPPOSED TO To be like God through God

 - Heiddeger. Hannah Arendt.


## Nathaniel 

 - JN 1:43-51
    - Can anything good come out of Nazareth?
    - Here is truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit. 
    - I saw you under the fig tree before Phili called you.
    - You are the Son of God! The king of Israel!

### Can anything good come Nazareth?

  - John 21:2 --- Nathanael is from Cana in Galilee
  - Rivalry between two small and similar towns.

  - This is the key for Daniel.

### Truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit/guile

 - Not "jew" but "Israelite
    - Wrestle with God
 - Philo says Israel means "One who sees God."
 - Israel and Jewish nation are not the same
 - deceit/guile is same word used by Isaac to describe Jacob
 - Jacob covers himself with animal skin to deceive Isaac, making him believe he is his brother and rival Esau

### Before Phillip called you

 - Before is "pro"
 - In the beginning was the word and the word was "pros" God
 - "Pros" could be spatial or temporal
 - I saw you under the fig tree 'in the place where' Philip called you
 - "I heard what you said"
 - Problem: 
    - I _saw_ you, not I _heard_ you
    - Pleonasm --- excessive use of words to describe 



### I saw you under the fig tree

 > Like grapes in the wilderness, I found Israel. Like the first fruits of the fig tree, in its season, I saw your ancestors.
 > --- Hosea 9:10

 > They shall all sit under their own vines and their own fig tree....

 - 1 Kings 4:25
 - 1 Macc 14:12

 - Invitation into the Messianic age.

 - Daniel: Aporia. Every path has a block.

 - Zechariah 3: Satan, High priest Joshua, and fig tree

 - Rabbi Akiva: "Under the fig tree" is a place where Jews study scripture.
    - Maybe he was reading about Jacob?

 - The greek word is sukein, where we get the words sycamore and sycaphant
    - sycaphant --- revealer of sins
 - Buddha was enlightened under the fig tree
 - Curses fig tree

 - Book of Susanna: "Under which tree did you see this take place?"
    - 2 judges try to rape S
    - 2 try to accuse S of adultery
    - Dan. uses tree testimony to reveal lie


> God knows that when you eat of the fruit, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.
> --- Gen 3:5


 - Fig as forbidden fruit.
    - Sewed fig leaves together after eating the fruit
    - some connection to Jacob covering himself
    - Gen 3 reference calling, seeing, being seen, and fig leaves
    - Is Jn 1:45-51 as midrash on Gen 3? Like prologue is Gen1 midrash? (with Jacob as an intertext)
    - Adam and Eve were hiding their naken, vulnerable bodies under fig tree
    - The fruit functions as a metaphor for the belief that God is our rival
    - Eating the fruit is acceptance of rivalry with god.
    - Humanity is expelled in Gen. God is expelled in Jn 1.
    - Gen as rivalry. Expulsion is the natural consequence of rivalry.
    - "Family systems theory" --- Friedman
    - Jn 1 reveals a God who sees our vulnerable and naked selves underneath our fig-tree coverings and sees us as true and without guile.
    - The "seeing" is perhaps metaphorical --- the form.
    - Nathanael --- means "gift of God" --- Jesus refers to his disciples 2x as "gifts from the father"

### You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel

 - Boyarin
    - Son of Man --- Divinity
    - Son of God --- Humanity
 - Philo calls the Logos the "Son of God"
    - Daughter
    - Metatron
 - Targum: Adam and Eve heard the Word of the Lord God walking in the garfen at the time of the evening breeze.
 - The Memra is the presence of God dwelling on earth
 - On John's version of Gen 3, the Memra does not chastise humanity (under the fig leaves)
 - Nathaniel knows that only the Memra, the Son of God, can clearly recognize the fig-tree coverings and see through them
 - Jesus did not need to hear Nath express his prejudice --- he sees it.
 - Jesus as Memra --- calling him Son of God IDs Jesus as Logos (maybe not?)
 - King of Israel alludes to Jacon and wrestling with God

### You (pl.) will see heaven opened and the angles ascending and descending upon the Son of Man

 - Jacob
    - covers humself himself with animal, motivated by rivalry
    - J and Rebek acted out of anxiety and the belief that God would not provide
    - is cast out into wilderness, knowing Esau wants to take his life
    - receives vision of God (gen 8)
       - Jacob dreamed that there was a ladder, set up on the earth, the top .... 28:12
    - through vision, God invites Jacob out of wilderness of rivalry

 - John --- You (the readers also) will see the heaven open.
    - First sign of water in wine.
    - the cross (heaven OPENED)
    - images of Jacob's ladder to describe the Passion
    - Does Jacon see the cross in his vision?
       - the "ladder" is something upright, not a literal ladder. 
       - God is "on the [ladder]" (word for God's standing is using same word as [ladder] standing; God beside him could be God on ladder.
       - I see you (naked), you will see me (naked)
       - Jacob is terrified
       - Jacob the deceiver then becomes vulnerable to being deceived himself (wrong daughter; from wrong son)
       - Tree of Life is the Cross
       - God invites Jacob out o the coverings and trappings of the wilderness of rivalry through a vision of divine vulnerability
       - God invites Nath into garden of vulnerability
       - The cross (tree of life) is the ultimate sign of the divine vulnerability and divine non-violence inviting us to remove our fig-tree which kee[ us stuck in the wilderness of rivalry
       - the cross is "in a garden"
       - if you eat from this tree, you will die --- you will be like God (God dies) --- Satan does not understand that God dies: "You will surely not die."

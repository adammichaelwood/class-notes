Anglicanism is not something that comes in a package --- it is _practiced_ in a variety of contexts.

Anglicanism _begins_ with the Reformation. English Christians were Roman Catholic _a lot_ longer than they have been Anglican. And ever since the Reformation, we have been arguing for a long time about what it means to be Anglican.

The big question under all the arguments is: What is the Church _for_? --- That brings us into mission.


## Talking about Mission

"There is only one name under heaven by which people can be saved, and that is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."

This idea makes mission tremendously urgent.

In the Middle Ages (13c), the Pope proclaims: outside the church there is no salvation.

Therefore: Mission _means_ getting people to believe in Jesus Christ so that they can be saved, that is --- to go to heaven when they die.

For most of Christian History, mission has been a process of Christian trying to persuade non-Christian to become Christian, for the good of their eternal souls.

In the NT period, the Roman Empire is the primary enemy of Christianity. 300 years later, Constantine legalizes Christianity. Then Justinian makes it the official religion. This means that mission is the activity of the Empire.

The church is the boat, the ark of salvation. (Nave from naval.) Get people into the boat.

In the 15th c. mission becomes the enterprise of the European Imperial powers. You cannot separate out the colonial process with the history of evangelism.

Mission meant not just spreading Christianity, but also spreading Western culture and Western civilization --- on the assumption that Western culture _is_ Christian culture.

The 19th c was the "crowning moment" of that movement. "The evangelization of the World in this generation." 

EX - Myanmar, musical culture destroyed.

Early 20th c. carried this on --- no salvation without Christ, and we can do it fast.

WW1 changed all this, as Christians went to war with each other, in the cruelest, most brutal war in history. European Christianity has never recovered.

19th c is the age of colonies and empire. 20th c is the century of liberation.

(Remember, though --- often, the missionaries hated the colonial machinery. But then, on the other hand, they also benefited from it and participated in it.)

So we need to think about mission in a new way...

### Missio Dei

If we start thinking about mission as _God's Mission_, not our mission or the church's mission --- this changes everything.

There has never been a time when God was not engaged in mission. God continually draws all people to himself.

The vision of mission is not everyone becoming Christian, but rather everyone being drawn into God.

Even Genesis --- creation --- is about mission. God is not satisfied by being alone.

To say that mission is about "saving souls for Jesus" is such a small part of it.

Salvation means "wholeness."

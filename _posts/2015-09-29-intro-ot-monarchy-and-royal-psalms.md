Deuteronomistic History ---

http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195393361/obo-9780195393361-0028.xml

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuteronomist 

Idea that Samuel, Kings, Judges (the "Former Prophets" is a single literary work, written in the 6th c. BCE, during the Babylonian exile.--- Is idea of Martin Noth.

The Deuteronomist was familiar with a version of Deuteronomy, and wrote the history through the lens of theology of that book.

Why did Israel need/want a King?

 - Samuel's sons are evil.
 - Want to be like other nations.
 - Wanted a human king, instead of God.
 - Didn't know what to do with the Philistines.


First mention of king:
Judges -- Gideon. After defeat of Midianites, Israel try to proclaim Gideon king. Gideon declines.

Saul is declared a "leader" or "prince."

He is not really a king: no army, no city, no palace, no tax system, barely any administration.

David is the first "real" King, and is idealized in the text.

 - Walled city
 - organizes a standing army
 - creates taxes

Jerusalem is chosen, because it is between tribes, it does not belong to one tribe in particular. David brings the Ark.

As a political symbol, Jerusalem diminishes the authority of the tribes. It also becomes a religious center.

David expands Israel, as if building an Empire. He marries Saul's daughter Michal, and kills Saul's descendent's.

The assessment that the LORD was "with David" is being made centuries after the fact.

Royal theology:

 - Yahweh has made a covenant with David --- 2 Samuel 7
    - Yahweh is with David
    - There will always be a Davidic King in Israel 
    - If Israel (or David's line) sins, they will be punished, but will not be abandoned
    - hesed --- steadfast love

Why would DH author write all this and make a big deal about it, if writing while there is no city, no temple, no king, no throne (during Bab. exile)?


Things get worse under Solomon.

Solomon divides the kingdom into 12 districts, eliminating the tribal system.

 - They are more like other nations. They got what they wanted.
 - More like Egypt under Pharoah.
    - Forced labor
 - More secure, more protected --- but they are now servants of the King


Emergence of writing.

 - Empires use written texts to preserve cultural memory
 - used as tools for cultural education and socialization
 - an "official way to remember"

What is written:

 - Royal Psalms
 - Zion Psalms
 - Proverbs

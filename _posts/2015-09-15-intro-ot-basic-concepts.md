## The word Bible, and issues of Canon

 - from GK "Biblos" --- Book
    - used first by Christians
 - an anthology
    - different people
    - different times
    - different ideas

 - OT/HS does not contain _all_ the books that the ancient Israelites considered authoritative or normative
    - ex. "Annals of the Kings" mentioned in Kings.

 - Does the word "Bible" convey a single meaning to all people in all places in all times? NO.

 - The Bible is a product of communities.
    - It didn't fall out of heaven.

 - Canon is a way to define what is the Bible, and also defines the community.

 - Calling the Hebrew Bible the "Old Testament" claims a specifically Christian interpretation of the texts

 - Scripture does not relate history in a factual sense


## Geography

 - Niles, Tigris, Euphrates rivers define border of Ancient Near East

 - Civilization grows up around rivers

 - Egypt was more stable because Nile flooding was predictable.

 - Mesopotamia more volatile because unpredictability of river flooding

 - PAlestine (Canaan) was right between the two great empires, at the crossroads fo major trade routes and military routes
    - Children of Israel are right in the middle of all this, but the smallest of the small
    - Dream of being like other nations, with wealth and power
    - cf. Samuel --- we want to be like other nations
    - They never came to power, never became an Empire. (AW: THAT'S WHY THEY WERE CHOSEN!)

## The Bible as Sacred Scripture

What does it mean that we call the Bible "sacred" or "the Word of God?"

Meaning is not _in the text_, but occurs (or arises) within the interaction between the reader and the text.

Meaning is not under the control of the author.

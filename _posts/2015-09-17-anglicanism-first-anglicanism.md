 - Like an ordination


The Ecclesiology of the English Reformation is one of national churches.

 - This develops out of a strong sense of English nationalism.
 - The church is going to reflect its own context. (As opposed to the idea of a universal or pure "Christianity.")
    - 

## English of the 16th c. are a _hybrid_ people:

    - Calvinist theology
    - _Via Media_
       - JK thinks this is not a helpful conception
    - Richard Hooker --- theology, perhaps greatest Anglican theologian
       - thought he was Calvinist, but wasn't
       - Scripture is ultimate authority
          - there is no three-legged stool
          - Tradition and Reason are the tools we have for interpreting scripture
       - The Bible is not immediately clear, it has to be interpreted (this diverges from continental Protestantism, who talked about the "plain meaning")
       - The Bible doesn't have the answer for everything --- the "silence of the Bible"
       - We _never_ have absolute certainty, only probabilities (__AW__: look into this.)
       - distinguish between what is essential and what is _adiaphora_ (indifferent)
          - he thought the Episcopate was _adiaphora_, but that it was okay to have them, and even useful. Also hierarchy is a good thing.
       - Roman church is corrupt, but not hopeless.


JK: For Anglicans in their formative period, _order_ is of primary importance.

AW: Reminds me of Aquinas.

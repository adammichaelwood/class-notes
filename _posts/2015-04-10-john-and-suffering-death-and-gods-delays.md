 - "Hades" in Septuagint
 - Fromt he dead...thanksgiving has ceased (Ben Sira 17:28)
 - If I die, I can no longer praise you (Ps 6:5)
 - What are the benefits of this understanding of the afterlife?
    - No great reward or punishment
    - This life is the one that matters

### Death and Beyond

 - Dead bodies belonged to the domain of the "unclean"
 - Priests, Levites, and Nazirites were forbidden to touch dead bodies or attend funerals
 - Uncleanness lasted one week and could only be removed by two ritual purifcatory baths
 - Bible orders bodies to be buried on the day of death; derived from primitive hygiene in country of hot climate
 - In popuar Jewish beleif the human spirit hovered near the body for three days, then departed as the color of the corpse began to change
 - Intense mourning during that time, so spirit can watch
 - Death was irrevocable and all hope abandoned for someone buried for four days (Qoheleth Rabbah 12:6; Leviticus Rabba 18:1)

### Jewish Ghosts

 - The dead do not simply vanish
 - They are emptied and weakened shades (rephaim)
 - King Saul and the woman of Endor awaken Samuel from Sheol
 - Disturbed and wrapped in a robe, Samuel foretells Saul's death

### Victory over Sheol

 - God will ransom my soul from Sheol (Ps 49)

 - My flesh and my heart mai fail, but God is my portion forever (Ps 73)

 - If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there (Ps 139)

 - Do not forget, there is no coming back.(?)

### Resurrection of a Nation

 - Come let us return to the Lord; for he has torn, that he may heal us; he has stricken, and he will bind us up After two day he will revives us; on the third day, raise us up. - Hosea 6:1-2

 - Elisha's bones revive a corpse
 - The resuscitatino of a recently deceased person may be classifed as the highest achievement of religious healing

### Resurrection?


> The dead do not live;
    shades do not riseâ€”
because you have punished and destroyed them,
    and wiped out all memory of them.
Your dead shall live, their corpses[a] shall rise.
    O dwellers in the dust, awake and sing for joy!
For your dew is a radiant dew,
    and the earth will give birth to those long dead.
--- Isaiah 26: 14, 19

 - Daniel 12:2 -- first definite expression of belief in resurreciton of the dead.

### Martyrdom and Resurrection

 - In 168 BCE Antiochus IV Epiphanes transforms Temple into sanctuary for Zeus

 - Eleazar (99 years old) and seven brothers surrender their lives rather than transgress the Torah by eating swine flesh

 - Those who remain faithful to the Torah should enjoy long life

 - Palestinian Jews came up with the bodily resurrection while Greek-speaking Jews in the Diaspora opted for the Platonic liberation of soul from body.

 - I got my tounge and hands form God...

### Abraham's Bosom

> After dying in this way, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will receive us and all our forefathers will praise us.  
> --- 4 Mac 13:17

> Many will come form the East and West and will eat with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.  
> --- Matt 8:11

During 2TJ, Abraham's bosom came to be understood as a resting place in Sheol where the righteious dead await judgement

### Diverse Beliefs in Resurrection

Psalms of Solomon 

2 Baruch

Wisdom 2:23-3:4

When we are living, the soul is dead and has been entombed in the body as a sepulchre; whereas shoudl we die, the soul lives fortwith its own proper life , and is released fromt he body, the baneful corpse.
 --- Philo in Allegory

- Josephus on Saducees:
 - Saducees do not beleive in resurrection

- on Essenes
   - Beyond the ocean
   War 2:154-157

The doctrine of the resurrection is firmly held among them (the Essese). For they confess that the flesh also will rise and be immortal as the soul is already immrtal,

Dead Sea monastics:
 - The Sons of light are promised eternal joy in life without end, a crown of glory and a garmnet of majesty

 According to Josephus, the Pharisees believed that only pious alone seem to enjoy corporoal revival

 Resurrection of the dead become pivotal teaching of Rabbinic Judaism

 - Menorah as most common symbol on Jewish tombstones
    - Symbol of resurrection?
    - Yearning for light in darkness of grave

 - Ancient inscriptions on tombstones:
    - If you open this grave, you will lose your portion in eternal life.
    - Friends, I am waiting for you here.
    - Good luck with your resurrection.

### Resurrection in John 11
 
   - This illness does not lead to death.
   - Our friends Lazarus has fallen asleep
   - Lazarus is dead.
   - I am the resurrection and the life
   - Jesus is the One who embodies resurrection
   - Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live; and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die.
   - For those who believe in Christ, death is like a sleep from which they can be awakened
   - Death looks permanent, bu isn't

   - Many hoped and assumed that Jesus would return before the first generation of believers all died out (Matt 16:28, Mark 9:1, Luke 9:27)
   - For 2000 yr, this same hope has remained unfulfilled
   - Why does God delay? Why did Jesus delay for two days after learning of Lazarus's illness? How do we respond to God's delays?


## Jewish Lectionary in John

 - Characteristics of 4G that suggest it is written with lectionary in mind:
    - Divergence from Synoptic Gospels (Judea not Galilee)
    - Historical time subordinated to liturgical cycle
       - Cleansing of Temple
    - Gospel does not progress in a straight line, but seems to spiral (Countryman: labyrinth)

### Trienniel Cycle

Years start...

    - Isaiah 54:9 ff
    - Jesus quotes Is. 54:14

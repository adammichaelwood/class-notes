Most (all?) of Latin American Anglican churches arose from breakaways from Roman Catholicism.

(but also...)

Many CofE and Episcopal chaplaincies set up to minister to American and English business settlers. Also, West Indian workers.

(oh yeah, and...)

Missionary Societies.
 - 1880s to Brazil (Virginians Seminarians?)
 - 1920s --- Brazil invites Japanese to settle agriculture land. Japan sends Anglican priests.
 - [South American Mission Society (SAMS)](http://samsusa.org/) --- extremely Evangelical. Established Anglican presence in Argentina, Paraguay, etc. --- Anglican Church of the Southern Cone


Observations of LAtin America

 - high degree of ownership --- take their Anglican identity very seriously 
 - still haunted by the legacy of the missionaries
    - "the Anglican Church in Argentine is more a cultural center than a community of faithful in mission"
 - sense of isolation --- in most places, it is a _long_ way from the "mother church" (whether US, UK, Australia)
 - frozen, time-capsule quality from period of missionaries
 - easy for churches to become eccentric and extreme because there is a lack of diversity and connection with the larger Communion
 - insularity and lack of communal oversight can lead to out-of-control abuse and general craziness (Bishops doing things like stealing, excommunicating all their priests, advocating oddly specific ways of being "Anglican")
 - lack of clergy education

Anglican Church in Brazil

 - very different (than the rest of Latin America)
 - concern for poor
 - theologically progressive, well-educated
 - large Asian minority
 - much more engaged with the issues of contemporary Episcopal Church and CofE --- sexuality, gender, etc.
    - Recife --- schism at hands of anti-gay bishop who aligned with Southern Cone


## Liberation Theology

Comes out of a way of doing theology after WW2, and especially after the Second Vatican Council.

V2

 - aggiornamento
 - what are the gospel imperatives

Conferences in LAitn America, led by liberation theologians who had been present at V2. Sparks a movement.

Is a response to:

 - extreme poverty
 - extreme repression

The tone of theological reflection becomes: what does the Christian faith say to poor and oppressed people.

Jon Sobrino: 

 - you can't understand the Gospel if you don't understand "the reign of God."
 - the "preferential option for the poor"

If this is the basis for theology, what does it mean for the church's ministry?

 - mission is about bringing about the reign of God, not about getting people to come to church


(Base commmunities.)

Liberation theology uses, as its philosophical basis, Marxism.

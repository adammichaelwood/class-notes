## Memory

Memory is one of the things that defines us as human beings. Remembrance is probably a unique skill of human beings.

We act today in a way that is related to what we hope for tomorrow, and also remembering our past.

If we want to know about someone, we ask them about their personal history --- that is what defines them.

So knowing our past helps us understand ourselves.

This is also true for communities.

Communities are unified through their remembrance. We do rituals in order to remember. We do these because w need to remember constantly, and if we don't this we will forget, and we will lose ourselves.

If an alien were to come here, what would you tell them about what makes us a nation:
 - history
 - wars
 - migrations

To be a part of this culture, we need to share history. These events need to be _retold_ and _reenacted_ --- __constantly__ --- generation after generation.

This is the same with the Jews.

 - Tradition
 - Memory
 - History that goes back thousands of years.

These events, as narrated in the Bible (and enacted in rituals) are what give them a sense of community, a sense of identity.

Same with Christians.

The Church is diverse, divided. We have different histories --- but we have a shared history and identity in the story of the life of Jesus Christ.

Jews, Christians, and Muslims all trace their heritage back to Abraham. They see Abraham as the beignning of a story, the beginning of a way to remember who they are, and a way to relate to God.

### What is the Old Testament?

It is a way to remember.

Name for it (OT / Hebrew Bible) is a ideologically charged issue --- what we call it determines our point of view.

**AW** Can we call it OT? 


Jews today call it _TaNaK_ --- same content as Protestant Bible, but differently arranged.

#### Hebrew Bible

 - Torah - Pentateuch - First Five books.
 - Prophets --- _Neviim_ - (not just the Prophets as we know them) --- commentary on the Torah
 - Writings --- _Ketuviim_ Psalms, Song of Songs, Ruth, etc.


#### Different Arrangements

Hebrew Bible ends with Malachi, for Jews it ends with 2 Chronicles.

Malachi is Messianic, talking about Elijah.

2 Chronicles ends with the exile to Babylon.

#### Different Canons

Christians were reading the Septuagint (LXX). 

Today, there are different canons:

 - Protestant 
 - Catholic
 - Orthodox
 - Oriental Orthodox (Monophys.)

What is Biblical spirituality?
 - BAsed in scripture
 - Preaching, drawing from 
 - academic study of scripture* (?)

Hermeneutical circle:
 - life
 - literature
 - learning
 - life
 - etc.

Big question for SS:
What is the problem with people and the resurrection?
 - Our (modern) stumbling block is the _bodily_ resurrection of Jesus.
 - Where is the body?
 - Imaginative Plausibilty. (I believe it, but I cannot imagine it.)
    - AW: What about apophatic approaches?
    - AW: What about liturgy as a means to form our imagination?
    - AW: What about literature? (Lewis, Tolkien, Chesterton on fantasy)
 - This lead to a focus on the _literature_ --- scripture, specifically John.
    - And other literature, including Girard.
    - And [?], a Psychoanalyst.
    - "The kind of literature that a modern mind can understand."
       - AW: Maybe this (modern mind) is problem.
       - AW: What about Post-Modern.
 - This is not optional. You have to reach people through their own intellectual doors.
    - This is not just a fad. We do, in fact, know new things.
 - This becomes a hermeneutical lens on the scripture, as well as:
    - Death
    - Sacrament
    - etc.

Girard...
 - "Unleashing through all of time."
 - Social disorder had reached such a pitch, that a scapegoat becomes necessary.
 - Jesus is "sufficiently different" from us.
 - Contemporary violence becomes scapegoating, but scapegoating is less and less effective.
    - AW: Are we sure it isn't the violence of rivalry?
 - [Some guy] - nature or original sin:
    - not lust, or pride, or disobedience
    - so what was it?!
    - FEAR.
    - Serpent 
    - Like God = ontological self-sufficiency.
    - until you seize _that_, you are vulnerable. You will die.
    - "You surely will _not_ die."
    - Sin comes from our fear of non-existence.
    - Paul: Christ did not see being God as something to be GRASPED AT (like Adam and Eve did).

And so therefore...

 - Resurrection is not about a reward for Jesus (which is simply resuscitation).
 - IT is not a reset or erasure of the crucifixion.
 - It is the END OF DEATH. "Death, where is your victory?"


Behold the lamb of God...

 - Here is the person who will resolve the human dilemma

John's Great Commission:
 - Whose sins you forgive, are forgiven.
 - Jesus takes away the SIN of the world, and the Church takes away the SINS of the world.
    - AW: AH HA!! Plural in liturgy.
 - Church has reduced this to a _magical_ ritual which excludes.

WHO is this lamb?

 - Three OT txts have lamb:
    - Suffering Servant in IS.
       - Servant is apprehended by
       - Death is accepted by servant, ratified by God, and salvific for the people
       - JN:
          - marred in his appearance, beyond recognition
          - placed among evil-doers
          - pierced for our offenses
          - assigned a grave among the rich
          - silent before his shearers
    - Passover Lamb in Exodus
       - Sacrifice a lamb without blemish
       - sprinkle blood of lamb with hyssop
       - JN:
          - hyssop branch
          - legs of Jesus not broken
    - Binding of Isaac
       - This unties Gordian knot of relationship between sacrifice and Christ...
       - Defied exegesis forever, by both Jews and Christians:
          - Is God the kind of god who demands sacrifice? or who demands loyalty through killing?
       - JN:
          - "your son, your only son, whom you live"
          - carrying his cross by himself
          - up the hill
          - BUT at the last minute Isaac is saved, but Jesus is not.
       - We need to delve into the typology more:
          - ABRM is and _is not_ THE FATHER.
             - A _thinks_ that love requires him to give up the thing he loves the most to prove that he loves God more.
             - A puts his loves in rivalry.
             - God tells A that he is wrong.
             - God does not require the destruction of what we love.
             - Like Amos "should I give the fruit of my loins" God: "No. Live justly, walk humbly, etc"
          - ISC is and _is not_ Jesus.
             - ISC is rescued, Jesus is not.
             - A+I proves that God does not desire human sacrifice.
             - Therefore, we have to interpret the sacrifice of Jesus _without_ reference to God's need for human sacrifice.
          - The "holocaust of the heart"
             - Love God, even unto death.
             - Not death by God's hand, but
             - Death at the hands of humans

What is the role of suffering in the salvation of the world?

 - Wrong: The more suffering, the better.
 - "Orgasm of violence."
 - Yes, Jesus's suffering is terrible, but.
    - NOT because of God's wrath.
 - Suffering Servant
    - People "test" God to see if God' really loves the servant
    - Servant is not rescued.

SO THEREFORE:

What is salvific about the death of Jesus?

 - Not just for believers, but also for those who killed him.
 - Girard: How is Jesus like the scapegoat?
    - Similar, in that Jesus is blamed for all the stuff. 
    - This works because the SG is _different than us_. 
    - BUT - Jesus is _not different than us_. He is "like us in all ways but sin."
       - The only way that he is different is that he definitely cannot be blamed.
    - Jesus wipes away both the lie of guilt and the lie of innocence.
    - "He is guilty because we handed him over to you."
    - Jesus is not only not guilty of the thing he is being accused of, but not guilty of anything at all.
       - AW: Our usual (and modern) scapegoats may not be guilty of what we accuse them of, but they are definitely guilty of something. This doesn't make it just, but does provide "moral cover" for the persecution.
    - Jesus UNDOES all of this.
       - Commissions disciples to make this available to all.
       - Jesus does this "radically."
          - AW: We are destroying the fruit of the tree which Jesus has already struck down.
          - AW: IS there anything _supernatural_ about any of this?
       - These things I have, done you will do.
       - AW: We are the body of Christ. We continue to do the mission of Jesus in history, throughout the whole world.


The resurrection is the revelation of what the glorification means.
 - Jesus is glorified in his death, not his resurrection.
 - The disciples think Jesus was destroyed. But what actually happened is that Jesus destroyed destruction itself.


AW: On PoMo issue:
 - Modernism is the state of the disciples between the death and the resurrection. We must move into a POST MODERN / POST RESURRECTION period. (This happening now, but in fits and starts.)
 - Perhaps PoMo is the shattering moments of "where have they put him" and the post-Easter reality experienced by the church is the present (post-post-modern) integrationist movement. (MSG Bartlett.)


SS:
 __"Humanity is now the second person of the trinity"__

 - Jesus is the Son of Man _forever_.


Q: How do we stop scapegoating scapegoaters?
A: Nonviolence. 
(AW: 1%)

"We can not get past scapegoating by scapegoating the scapegoaters. We simply have to stop."


Q: If body is no longer physical, what about the wounds?
A: 
 - This is a confusion of literature as history. (MU)
 - The wounds are _glorified_.
 - They are not still bleeding, etc.
 - But the marks of the passion are still with Christ.
 - The resurrection is not a reset of the passion.
 - The humanity of Jesus is integrated into the mystery of the Trinity
    - Ascension is important because Christ takes his humanity into God. He does not sluff off his human body and ascend as a spirit.
 - There is a real continuity between the historical Jesus and the Easter Jesus.
 - No longer bound by time, space, causality.
 - The reality of the passion and death are carried forth into the resurrection.

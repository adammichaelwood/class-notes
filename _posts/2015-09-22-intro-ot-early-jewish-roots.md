## Oral Tradition

Before anything was written, the Israelites told these stories, and they underwent a long process of change and evolution.

The oral traditions didn't appear out of nowhere --- they arose out of the specific circumstances of the time.

Example: Rainy season. Very unpredictable. This molded how the people understood God.

Short life expectancy.

Small villages in the hill country. No protection, as in fortified cities.

Lack of political unity.

 - Segmentary society.
 - Just surviving.
 - Lack of resources.

What kind of oral traditions?

 - Origins
 - Genealogies
 - Songs

## Different Perspectives

 - Joshua
    - Joshua takes _all the land_, putting it to _utter destruction_.
    - Easy, quick, complete.
 - Judges
    - According to the narrative structure, it _appears_ that the events of Judges occur after Joshua, but they also seem to recount the same events --- that is, the expansion of Israelites into Canaan.
    - Judges presents a slower, less total migration that includes inter-marrying and cultural integration.

## John 12 --- My hour has come

### Annointing of JEsus's feet in Ephraim

 - Fragrance is not present in Synoptic
 - Fleshy, good with intimacy
 - the Light that is within all life.
 - Newell

### Entrance to Jerusalem

 - Palms --- sukkot (maybe)


### The Hour has Come

 - Parable of wheat that dies and bears much fruit

 - "Now is the judgement of this world." -12:31
 - This act of self-giving love will judge the world by revealing those who are on the side of the accuser and those on the side of the innocent accused

 -The ruler of this workd will be driven out. - 12:31b
 - The Accuser will be recognized as evil and will begin to lose its power.

   (DL: Verses make more sense in light of a mimetic theory)

 - I will draw all to myself. - 12:32
 - not "all people" in the Greek
 - DL: All of each person.

 - I do not judge anyone who hears my words and does not keep them, for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. - 12:47

 - Jesus gets very "fleshy" with his disciples as he takes off his outer robe, pours water into a basin, washes his disciples feer and then wipes them clean with the towel wrapped around the waist

 - This was Jesus's way of ordaining his disciples as the new high priests

 - In 2TJ, priests had to wash (a lot)

 - Presumably, the disciples had already purified themselves for Passover, as did the pilgrims from the country (11:55)

 - This additional foot washing was a priestly requirement

### Foot washing in place of Last Supper

 - Foot washing _in place of_ last supper as commentary on the outlook we must share in receiving the eucharist

 - Followers in early church grew divided over disputes about the Eucharist

 - If we are not willing to wash another Christian's dirty feet, we hve not understood self-giving

 - This is why the foot-washing necessary.

 - Brown wonders if followers of Jesus had chosen to imitate the washing of the feet instead of the breaking of the bread, if they would have overlooked the spirit of self-giving to the extent to which they have in disputes over the eucharist

### Meet the Beloved Disciple

 - The one whom Jesus loved was reclining next to him -13:23

> Reckoned worthy to recline on the breast of the Lord. --- Coleman of Whitby

### Peter vs. BD

 - Chapter reflects political tensions between mainline Petrine churches and the marginal Johanine community 
 - Peter apparently has to go through the Beloved Disciple to get to Jesus
 - Johannine community was closer to the heart of the master and the Petrine churches needed them to interpret Jesus words

 - Peter brashly insists that he will lay down his life for Jesus (13:38)
 - In contrast, BD makes no such claim, but proves to be the only male disciple who stays with Jesus at the foot of the Cross

### Listening to the Heartbeat of God

 - _Mandatum novum_

 - Newell invites readers to hold both:
    - Roman/Petrine/Matthean way of seeing
    - Celtic/Johannine (earth-affirming flesh-affirming)

Aside: The arrival of the Greeks is what prompts Jesus to say that his hour has come.

 - What do we do when "the other side" does not want to embrace diversity and wants to stomp out?

 - Loving one another means being vulnerable and open to attack

 - Are we willing to love even if it might lead to our death?

## John 14

### I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me

 - John J. Collins: _Does the Bible Justify Violence?_
    - Take the Bible with less certainty


 - Jesus embodies the only way to God: that is, the way of self-giving love

 - If one wants to experience God as a loving Father (abba) then Jesus is the Way

(AW: Trinity)

### He will give you another Paraclete

 - Paraclete is the Advocate
 - According to Martin Buber, Job's suffering and prayer caused him to see God as His witness against God himself
 - Job was caught between god the Accuser an God the Advocate
 - Christ chows the Truth between god the Accuser and God the Advocate because Christ, as the deified Advocate and innocent victim victim is and embodies the Truth

### The Paraclete will teach you everything

 - The Father gives us the Paraclete as our hermeneutical lens _par excellence_

 - The Paraclete (Advocate) helps us see and discern the subtle ways of the Accuser in Scripture, in history, in the world, and in our lives.

 - The Paraclete has been gradually successful in making us more aware of and concerned for the plight of innocent victims

### I am the True Vine

 - Was Jesus implying a false vine?

    - Israel the false vine?

    - Golden vine adorning eastern gates of temple.
       - Stood over the entrance to the sanctuary
       - People would donate golden leaves.
       - When the temple treasury was in need, the treasurer took from the vine as much as was required
       - The golden vine was a visible sign of the wealth of the temple

       - Option of attaching either to the false golden vine from which they will receive honor and glory from others OR Jesus the true vine, which is love and friendship

### I am the vine, you are the branches

 - Vine in comparison with Body (Paul)
    - body is hierachical
    - vine is not --- all parts equal
       - the only distinction is between those that remain and those that fall away

## John 16 --- The Joy of BEing Wrong

### The time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering service to God

 - Since the days of Cain, humanity has been blindly caught up in collective violence cloaked in religion

 - Jesus's death reveals the violent murder hidden underneath the "sacred" so that we can no longer speak of it unequivocally as "service to God"

 - Paul himself thought he was offering service to God by persecuting the followers of the Way

 - According to Acts, God appeared to Paul as the victim

### Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete

 - God is not your rival, but is rather eager to give you everything you need

### I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.

 - Father has never been a rival, but is rather literally dying to be partners with us in the dynamic and diverse dance of deathless interpenetration and co-creation. --- James Alison, _joy of Being Wrong_, Ch 7


## John 17 --- The High Priestly Prayer

### After he had spoken these words, he looked up to heaven

 - According to the Synoptics, Jesus prays frequently
   - but the Gospels do not say what he prayed

 - Jesus enters the Holy of Holies through prayer

 - ONce a year, on Yom Kippur, the high priest would enter the Holy of Holies to pray for the people

### Chiasmus Jn 13-17

 - Wayne Brouwer, _Literary Development of John 13-17_

## Yom Kippur: The Day of Atonement

### Yom Kippur

 - Day of penitential fasting, praying, and mourning for sins

 - The sabbath of Sabbaths (no work, no sex)

 - Instant Lent

 - During the time of the First Temple, two identical goats were chosen
    - One for the LORD
    - One for Azazel

 - During the following rituals, the high priest (Kohen Gadol) wore five sets of garments, immersed in the mikvah five times, and washed his hands and feet ten times
 - He wore on his forehead a golden seal engraved with the Tetragrammaton
 - Wearing the Name enabled the high priest to carry, or to forgive (nasa) the sins of the people
 - Hosanna (save us) Blessed is he who comes in (with) the name of the Lord.

 - The _Letter of Barnabas_ (4th cent) quotes from a prophetic text we no longer have, explaining that the sacrificed goat was eaten by the priests raw and mixed with sour vinegar

 - This shows that blood was consumed in temple rites

 - Barnabas connects this with Jesus drinking the vinegar (only happens in John)

 - Second goat is taken away for Azazel
    - "goat that goes away"
    - thrown off cliff (Jesus is often taken to cliffs)
    - One goat for the Lord, one goat for Azazel
       - One goat _as_ the Lord, one _as_ Azazel

## Theories of Atonement

 - Atonement theories seek to answer the question: "Why did Christ die?"

 - Four major models
    - Christus Victor (classic)
    - Satisfaction (scholastic)
    - Moral (idealist)
    - Penal substitution (a development of satisfaction)

### Christus Victor

 - Irenaues of Lyon 
    - Just as humankind was condemned by one man, so humankind was redeemed by one man
 - Origen of Alexandria: Christus Victor as Ransom
    - The son of man came to give his life as a ransom to many.
    - During the collapse of Rome, gans kidnapped and demanded ransom
    - Christ is the Ransom paid to the Devil for enslaved humanity, but then the Devil cannot hold him
 - Gregory of Nyssa
    - Christ was the ransom that God paid to the Devil, but the Devil was tricked and could not hold God

### Satisfaction

 - Anselm rejects the notion of a debt owed the devil
 - Christ's death offers satisfaction to God for the debt owed to God by sinful humanity
 - Anselm is influenced by his setting: Feudal lords, honor, debt
 - _Cur Deus Homo_
    - Why didn't God simply forgive humanity?
    - First book describes the situation without Christ
    - Second book describes how Christ fulfills the needs 
    - Sin is our failure to repay a debt owed to God, which dishonors God
    - We must offer compensation for the isult to God's honor
    - Because of the degree of sin and the great status of the One offended, the debt is immense, even infinite.
    - Can one human pay the debt for another?
       - No.
    - The debt payer would have to be human, but also better than human.

    - IS this DIVINE CHILD ABUSE?
    - Anselm allowed medieval concepts of honor to define how God ought to act


### Moral Influence (Idealist)

 - Peter Abelard
    - Jesus sees Jesus's life and death as a demonstration of God's love that moves sinners to repent and love God
    - The example of Jesus's life arouses within us a greater love of God, and we become more righteous
    - The cross was not so much about removing a barrier between God and human but rather a demonstration to humanity of God's matchless love

### Penal Substitution

 - Charles Hodge
    - God, who is holy, cannot associate with us because we are unholy sinners unless...
    - There is punishment for our sin
    - Christ does not pay a debt that humans owe to God but rather bears the punishment of God against human sin
    - In this model, Jesus essentially came to save us from God.

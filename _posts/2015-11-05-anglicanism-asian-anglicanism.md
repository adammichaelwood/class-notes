Top of class: 

 - Kater on hybridity. Maybe hybridity is the hallmark of Anglicanism, rooted in the hybridity of the English people.

 - Kater on Post-colonialism. It doesn't mean (neccesarily) that [we] get rid of things because they have a problematic colonial heritage, but asking --- what does this mean _for me?_ And recognizing that what it meant for them is not the same as what it means for me.

Anglicanism comes to Asia in two forms:

 - Colonial activity from UK and US
 - Missionary territory

Whereas Anglicanism in Africa is interacting with tribal cultures, in Asia they are interacting with the great world religions --- Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Confuscianism, Taoism.

Southeast Asia (India, Pakistan) was basically feudal states. Tremendous amount of religious, ethnic, cultural, and linguistic integration.

The British colonial strategy in South India was similar to Roman Imperial strategy --- leave the local civil system intact. Imposing a British cultural super-structure over the local.

(Watch [Indian Summers on Masterpiece Theatre](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/programs/indian-summers/) for a sense of what this was like in late colonial period.)

British rule allowed East India Company (EIC) to run everything, and they were _against_ missionary activity. They did allow chaplains.

CMS refused to go along with EIC's policy. [Henry Martyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Martyn) translated Bible into several languages. [Reginald Heber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Heber) was heavily invested in the missionary effort.

1857 --- [Indian Mutiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857). Independence revolt. This causes control to pass from East Indian Company to governance directly by the Crown. This paves way for CofE to move in.

 - Diocesan structure
 - English Bishops
 - 1662 BCP imposed

1883 --- English Bishops of Indian, pastoral letter: We do not wish to impose anything distinctly English. They say they want an Indian liturgy. But they don't. Actually.

In most cases in Asia, the missionaries were not at all welcome. ("One more Christian, one fewer Chinese.")

The missionaries found:
 
 - poverty
 - caste system
 - violent sexism
 - [Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_(cultural))
 - hopelessness

Japan

In China and Japan, there had been two waves of mission in earlier centuries.

During 19th c. the missionaries show up during a time of great cultural unrest, as [Shoguns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogun) were falling out of power in the [Meiji Restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration).

In Japanese culture, there was a sense of two identity: the public and the private identity. This has shaped Japanese Christianity. (cf. [Hidden Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Christians_of_Japan))

Many Japanese feel that they cannot be baptized, because their families will not approve.

Until WWII, public identity was Shinto (worship of the Emperor).

====

Korea

Late 19th / Early 20th c.

First missionaries were Anglican Monks with help from the SPG, giving Korean Anglicanism a distinctly Anglo-Catholic character.

[Rev. Charles John Corfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Corfe). 

Today --- Korean Christianity is mostly Calvinist, with a lot of charismatic prosperity-gospel.

====

China

Very large mission territory. Lots of missionaries from everywhere, every group.

[Chinese Holy Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chung_Hua_Sheng_Kung_Hui)

====

Philippines

Bishop Brent, missionary Bishop, would not mission to already-Christian places, so they went to the tribal areas, Chinese areas, and Muslim areas.

Philippines Independent Church is in full communion with TEC and Philipinne Episcopal Church.

Philippine Episcopal Church is seen as closely tied to the American invasion.

====

Anglicanism in Asia is something of a niche religion.

====

In 19th and early 20th c., there is a great passion for modernization, so Western institutions, western medicine, science, etc. become ascendant.

After WW2 (the Pacific War), the West (US) is seen as "the winner."

There continue to be struggles within Asian Christianity about the extent to which Western or Eastern forms are appropriate to Christian liturgy. (Flowers, Gongs, etc.)

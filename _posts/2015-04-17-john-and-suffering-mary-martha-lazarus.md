## Mary, Martha, and Lament

### Rebuking Jesus

 - If you had been here, my brother would not have died.

    - But I know that God will give you whatever you ask.

 - Although Mary and Martha are essentially saying the same thing, the word "my" takes a different position in the syntactical arrangement

 - Farley suggests the earrangement reflects "Mary' disordered and gasping speech"

 - Schnakenburg say "Mary gives the impression of being nothing but complaining woman"

 - Bruner suggests emphasis on "my" indicates a "why me in particular"

 - Moloney sees Mary words as indicative of her unconditional trust in the power of the presence of Jesus ... reflecting true faith while MArtha has fallen short of such faith"

 - Brown suggests that because MAry is at Jesus's feet she has a livelier faith

 - In the light of the Jewish lectionary readings (especially Psalms) assigned for Tebeth-Shebat, the complaints of MAry and Martha represent the Lament Psalms

### Brief Introduction to the Psalms

 - Brueggeman three categories:
    - Orientation
    - Disorientation
    - New Orientation

 - Psalm of Orientation
    - confident belief that the world is well-ordered, reliable and life-giving to the person of faith
    - include reflections on creation, wisdom, favor of God
    - 1, 8, 14, 33, 37, 104, 111, 112, 119, 131, 133, 145
 - Disorientation
    - reflect the brokenness of life
    - out of the depths; they are often still bold acts of faith
    - can be accusatory, but also deeply penitent
    - 13, 22, 32, 35, 50, 51, 73, 74, 79, 81, 86, 88, 130, 137, 143
    - 88 is the only one that does not end with trust and resolution
 - New Oritnetation
    - the pit is not the end of life; there is more
    - reflect the surprise of new possibilities
    - full of thanksgiving and praise
    - 23, 27, 30, 34, 40, 65, 66, 91, 100, 103, 113, 117, 124, 135, 138, 150

### Psalms of Tebeth-Shebat

 - Psalms (38, 39, 41) (88, 89, 90, 91) (141, 143)

### Psalm 88

 - DArkness
 - It is remarkable that Israel's rage against God did not drive Israel away from God to Atheism or idolatry, but more passionately into prayer addressed to God

 - ...my only companion is darkness

### Psalm 89

 - 1-38 recount promises of Yahweh
 - 39-52 recount the _broken_ promises of Yahweh
 - You raged at your annointed... you repudiated the covenant with your servant
 - How long, O Yahweh, will you estrange yourself

### Psalm 90

 - Includes complaint and insight inthe the nature of God
 - Turn, O LORD! How long?
 - Thousand years are like a day.
 - The Psalmist knows that God does not work according to human conceptions of time
 - DL: This is MArtha

### Psalm 91

 - 

### MArtha : Ps 90, 91

 - Martha compalins, BUT affirms her faith

### Divine Response

 - Christ challenges Martha to broaden and deepen her understanding of rsurrection and believe even more
 - Like Psalm 91, Martha's interaction with Crist ends on a positive, life-affirming note
 - Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one coming into the world.

### Mary's Complaint: Ps 88, 89

 - Psalm 88 "is a very unusual prayer for help"

 - Disordered gasping of 89
 - Frustration of 88 which ends in darkness
 - Responds by accepting her self-assertion, ego strength, and anger as an act og genuine faith
 - Jesus responds with one of the most profound acts of love
 - Jesus tears are an honest sharing in Mary's grief and perhaps in her anger at death, the enemy of life"
 - Jesus, in his most fully human moment in the 4G, legitimates human agony in the face of death
 - Jesus also legitimates Mary's self-assertion and her willingness to be painfully honest with her anger
 - M, M, and L are called "friends" of Jesus before the Twelve
 - As friends of Jesus, the bring their genuine frustration to God.

### Invitation of John 11
 - the raw self-assertion in M+M invite the reader to reclaim Jewish tradition of Lament

 - In so doing, we mayfind ourselves strangely and spiritually accompanied in our tears by the One who is deeply moved by our grief...

### JEsus's Humanity

 > Jesus in John is a god marching triumphantly 
  --- some guy

 - the greek word "troubled" is NOT used at all in the Synoptics to describe Jesus
 - But it is used to describe Jesus
   - 11:33
   - 12:27
   - 13:21

## Winnowed and Gathered Community: John 11:50-53

### Winnowed and Gathered

 > You do not understand that it is better for you to have one person die for the people than to have the whole nation destroyed. --- Caiaphas

 - Caiaphas seeks to temporarily placate rivals by scapegoating an innocent victim

 - C is successful in uniting rival groups against Jesus and saves the nation from Roman destruction (at least temporarily)

 - "Girard's fundamental anthropology is a reflection upon [this] single biblical citation" --- Kirwan, 72

> He did not say this on his own, but being high priest tha year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation, __and not for the nation only, but to gather into one the dispersed children of God.__

 - As a norma, sacrificial scapegoat, Jesus died for all those in the tense community of Roman-occupied Jerusalmen whose peace might be at least temporarily maintained by charging him with responsibility for their division. (Heim)

 - Jesus died _not for the nation only_

 - The greek word for dispersed refers to winnowing of grain

 - Christ shows us the chaff that contaminates our community

 - What does the chaff represent?
    - the scapegoat? (no)
    - the scapegoating? (yes?)

 - If the community depends on violent scapegoating, it i still "dispersed"

 - The chaff is the "ancient machinery of unity"

 - The winnowing fork that Christ that Christ wields is the miraculous act of resurrection

 - The grain represents the community that is no longer dependent on violent scapegoating

 - The dispersed children of God are gathered into one, not by scapegoating but by accepting God's forgiveness

 - The grain is free from chaff represents the community can now be free from scapegoating

 - The principal way by which all this is kept alive in our midst is: The Eucharist. (Alison, Knowing Jesus 85)

> Even as this broken bread was scattered over the hills and was gathered together and became one, so let Thy Church be gathered together from the ends of the earth into Thy Kingdom. --- __Didache__

 - This new community is founded upon the Eucharist.

 - The real presence of Jesus in the Eucharist is the real presence of the crucified and risen Lord, giving himself... making possible the conversion of those who participate (Alison, 85)

 - The Eucharist-centered community becomes one by the encountering the forgiving victim who is Christ

 - The forgiving victim "undoes" us by "winnowing" away our chaff and by dismantling our "ancient machinery of unity"

 - In what ways is the Christian, Eucharistic-centered community still contaminated by chaff?

    - Anti-semitism
    - Anselmian atonement (God as violent)


 - With the prophecy of Caiaphas, we get the first overt and ironic reference to the theme of universal salvation.

 - The old image of the gathering of the tribes of Israel is changed into a universal perspective

 - Ch 11, 12 "might be seen as a corrective to the exclusiveness of the rest of the Gospel" (Burke, 201)

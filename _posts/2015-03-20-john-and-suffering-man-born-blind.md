## Prelude: Oscar Romero

"Violence of love."

## Mimetic Theory / Notes from Papers

 - Negative anthropology --- original sin --- something unhealthy about our desires
 - Jewish --- yetzer (desire)
    - yetzer hara (bad [not exactly])
    - yetzer hatov (good)
    - story about jews praying for the removal of _yetzer hara_ --- "no eggs" --- they pluck out its eyes and let it come back into the world
 - Third insight of Mimetic Theory
    - J+C scripture reveals mechanism
       - God is on side of  victims
       - this revelation allows us to re-interpret scripture
       - however, this is not just about knowledge (gnosis).
       - It provides us an encounter with the victim
       - This is ultimately a spiritual encounter

 - What do we do with it?
    - work _toward_ moving past scapegoating
    - bring anger and violent impulses to God, as part of love toward God.
    - eschatological goal --- no sacrifice --- the city with no temple
    - James Allison --- dancing hippos

## Joshua 7:1-26

 - Israelites broke faith in regard to "devoted things" --- were supposed to destroy everything 
    - devoted to keep israelites form fighting with each other over spoils of war
 - Achan took the stuff
 - He is stoned to death

 AW:
  Mimetic scapegoating can be either unconscious or conscious. We are called by knowledge to consciousness. Once we have this consciousness, we can choose to be on the side of God and victims, or on the side of Satan and the accuser.
  We are sinful inasmuch as we become aware of sin AND continue to participate in it.
  This is the fall, through eating of the Tree of Knowledge and Good and Evil. You will be like God. Or like Satan.

## Interim

Three tools for exegesis
 - historical critical --- the world behind the text
 - literary critical --- the world of the text
 - ideological --- the world after the text

AW: It is _all_ ideological. HC and LC are tools used in the pursuit of ideological goals.






## God's Response to the Question of Suffering

### The question of Suffering

__Sidebar --- Buddha__
 - Siddhartha is in a pleasure palace, to keep him from encountering suffering
    - He leaves and encounters:
       - sick
       - old
       - dead
       - ascetic
    - Asks charioteer "What is the cause of suffering?"
    - Decides to spend rest of life to answer question
    - Sits under fig tree and discovers the four noble truths.

 - Compare Hindu->Buddhism to 2T Judiasm -> Christianity


> The genre of the fourth gospel is *theodicy*.  
> --- Margaret Davies, _Rhetoric and Reference in the Fourth Gospel_

### John 9 --- Man born blind

 - Disciples ask same question --- Why suffering
 - Jesus answers --- Neither. God's glory

> Jesus response presents an *unattractive theodicy**.

 - Maybe not.
    - Greek: Neither this one sinned not his parents; but in order to make manifest the work of God in him, we must work the works of him who sent me while it is day...
    - That is: punctuation matters. No punctuation in the Greek.


 - The pericope does not end until John 11
    - John 3
       - Narrative
       - Dialogue
          - Amen, amen, I say to you.
       - Monologue
    - John 9-10
       - Narrative 9:1-12
       - Dialogue 9:13-41
          - Amen, Amen, I say to you.
       - Monologue 10:1-39
          - Good shepherd
             - discourse
             - response
             - discourse
             - response
          - Chanukah discourse
             - discourse
             - response
             - discourse
             - response
    - Dodd understands 10:22 ff serving as an epilogue.

#### Judgement, Light, and sheep

> The dominant theme of this episode is not the coming of light , but its effect on judgment.

 - Light
    - philo
    - gen 15 (dream of brazier through sacrifice)


 - Hebrew for "judgement"
    - soveriegn reward for good and punishing wicked
 - Greek for judgement - krinein
    - discern
    - functions as a medium for discernment
    - light does not just reward and punish, but reveals and illumines those who are engaged in good and wicked
 - Shepherd imagery deepens theme of judgement
 - Shepherd imagery depends on Ezekial 34 --- shepherds who feed themselves
    - I will set up over them one shepherd.


#### Interpreting the Response

> Who sinned?

 - By articulating our questions to God, we can begin to see the logic underneath our questions
 - Our drive to seek answers is connected to our drive to find someone to blame.
 - The conventional theology of the day was to blame sin
    - This reinforces the human compulsion to blame.

 - The Jewish tradition of protest against God serves not only as ahelpful resource in the midst of catastrophe, but it also creates space for honesty allowing light to shine on our human compulsion to blame
 - When we direct this compulsion towards God, Gos responds by gently opening our eyes to see how blinded we have become by our drive to blame

 - Jesus's healing of blindness should be seen as part of od's reponse to the question Who is to be blame
 - God sheds light to help us discern whether we are on the side of the victim of the accuser
 - Are we wolves or sheep?
 - This is why the imagery of light and sheep are part of the Gospel's answer.

Sidebar / AW:
  Wheat and tares. Some are "demons." Those who have alligned themselves with the accuser.


 - The judgement of the light is not a condemnation but an illumination, helping us to discern whose side we are on.
 - The Gospel's response to the question reaches its climax when Jesus says: I lay down my life for the sheep.
 - With these ords, Jesus says he is willing to give his life in defense of his flock and "act as an Advocate for his persecuted followers" (Dodd, 358)
 - Jesus is also willing to take the blame even if that means dying

 - Heroic shepherd.
 - Sometimes we ourselves are the wolf that our heroic shepherd goes out to meet.
    - The heroic shepherd *does not give up on the wolf*.
    - Offers his body --- true food --- to the hunger of the wolves.

 - This is God's ultimate response to the question of suffering: allowing Godself to be the object of blame in Christ even to the point of death.

Book: Guilt, Anger, and God --- Christopher FitzSimons Allison. (see p 86)

 - The Lamb of God is also our heroic shepherd, willing to die as a victim of our violence and respond with love
 - By doing so, he reveals to us that we are wolves and we no longer need to be
 - Through his love and sacrifice.

 - Chanukah douscourse (epilogue) --- Jesus invites the reader into mystical union with the divine through participation in heroic, self-giving love
 - By publicly claiming to be the Son of God, he makes himself much more vulberable to the vicious wolves
 - Being divine is deeply connected to being vulnerable
 - Jesus quotes Ps 82:6, which suggests other people can participate in the the divine
 - the way we participate in the divine is by standing with victims, even becoming victims
 - The Gospel's response to the qusiton o suffering is much more involved than Jesus' initial verbal response
 - Johannine Jesus invites us out of our blame-bound existence into the abundant life of self-giving love and divine vulnerability
       - People declare their own guilt or innocence in the manifestation of the light.

The Anglican tradition is a living tradition, and evolves with its context.

The pace of evolution picks up rapidly in the 19th century.

Industrial revolution is fueled by:

 - Capital from the colonies
 - Slave Trade
 - Steam Engine
 - Enclosure of public lands

Slum alcohol was a _serious problem_. (No wonder prohibition was a big issue for Christian progressives.)

Low wages were considered "ordained by God/nature" --- Supply-and-demand was a "natural law." (AW: Except not, because of the government-created glut of labor in cities, due to enclosure.)

This leads to demands for social change.

1829 --- Test Act repealed. Non-Anglicans can now be elected to Parliament.

Oxford movement begins when Parliament abolishes some Irish dioceses to save money. A small group in Oxford, opposed to Parliament's interference in the Church, begin meeting in order to determine their response. "The church is the prisoner of the government."

 - Tracts for the Times
    - How did we get to a point where Parliament gets to set rules for the Church?
    - The Reformation went to far
    - We have to restore the Church as it was before Henry VIII took it over
    - We need to do something
    - The Episcopate is the keystone for the Church's authority and identity

 - AngloCatholicism
    - Weekly Eucharist
    - Candles
    - Eucharistic vestments
       - Surplices
       - Stoles
       - Chasubles
       - Copes
    - Confession
    - "Branch Theory"
    - Church Defined by:
       - Bishops
       - Creeds
       - Sacraments

Many of the things advocated by the Tractarians were illegal. Also, Newman defected to Rome. Clergy are persecuted.

What does it mean to reclaim a Catholic identity for Anglicanism?

Things we have now that we owe to the Oxford movement:

 - flowers
 - candles
 - wafers
 - mixing wine and water
 - liturgical colors
 - stone altars
 - statues
 - icons and crucifixes
 - sacramental confession
 - prayers to the Saints
 - prayers for the dead
 - weekly Eucharist
 - vestments
 - plainsong
 - solemn high mass
 - reservation of the blessed sacrament
 - reverence to the blessed sacrament
 - the last Gospel
 - prayers to Mary
 - incense

Oxford Movement spread to the U.S. very quickly. 

A-C was first in conflict with both Evangelicals and conservatives.

But eventually, their work with the poor and slums earned them the respect of the rest of the Church.



[John Frederick Denison Maurice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Denison_Maurice) declared that LF capitalism was based on greed and violence, and developed Christian Socialism.

 - Economics based on class cooperation
 - classes may be part of God's plan, but
 - they should not exploit or oppress each other
 - People should be _educated_, so as to properly understand their obligation to society

Maurice also had a sense of Christian unity which included the idea that all the different traditions make up the Church.

Social Gospel movement began 1870s in the U.S.

Institutional parishes --- large, wealthy parishes developing social programs for the poor.

Also, settlement houses.


All of this basically stops with WWI.


## 19th Century Mission 

We can make the world better by converting the world to Christianity.

We have saving knowledge of God, and we must share it with the world.

Problem: Bishop Colenso thought it was unpastoral to tell African tribal people that their ancestors were doomed to hell.

Along with Evangelicalism is the belief that English culture and civilization is the pinnacle of social development. Also, Christianity _depends on_ Western civilization.

(This contradicts the "Anglican principle" of faith in context.)

[Henry Venn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Venn_(Church_Missionary_Society)), GS of CMS --- Look at how Paul did mission. Preach, and get out. "Career euthanasia."

The goal for Venn is local churches that are:

 - self supporting
 - self governing
 - self expanding

Most mission was _not_ conducted according to Venn's ideas.

Cultural context in India and China required the commissioning of female missionaries.

Mission is mostly carried out in a rather oppressive and paternalistic manner.

Lambeth.

1888 - [Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago-Lambeth_Quadrilateral) 

 1. The Holy Scriptures, as containing all things necessary to salvation;
 2. The Creeds (specifically, the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds), as the sufficient statement of Christian faith;
 3. The Sacraments of Baptism and Holy Communion;
 4. The historic episcopate, locally adapted.

## MAry Magdelene

### Apostle to the Apostle

 - NT sees her as first female apostle, possibly first apostle altogether

 - First to encounter the Risen Christ, who _sends her_ (_apostello_) to the the disciples

 - does not appear in Acts or Paul

### Demon-Possessed Prostitute

 - apostolic status downplayed

 - role as penitent prostitute stressed

 - perpetual virginity of Mary the Mother of Jesus upheld as ideal to emulate

 - genophobia has haunted the church for centuries

 - Why is it difficulty to imagine Jesus as a sexual person.

 - Gregory the Great conflates Mary Mag with the sinful woman who anoints Jesus's feet in Luke 7:36-50

 - MAG is never once called a prostitute in the New Test.

 - LK 8:2, she had 7 demons
    - Jean-Yves Leluoup: she has "done her psychological work"

### Gospel of MAry Mag

 - _The Gospel of Mary Magdelene_ traces the soul's progress through demonic voices of accusation
    - written in 2nd c.
    - mostly missing
    - discovered in 1896, published in German in 1955

 - The Gospel recounts a post-resurrection conversation between MAG and disciples

 - Disciples are fearful, MAG comforts them and plays role of Paraclete

 - Recounts the ascent of the Sou as it faces Darkness, Desire, Ignorance, Wrath

 - 14th C. --- Margeurite Porete --- _The Mirror of Simple Souls_ recounts a dialogue between a Soul and Love and Virtue
    - Heretic (Heresy of Free Spirit)
    - Beguine

 - The soul ascends into union with God so that the Soul has no will other than God's own

 - Huge influence on Meister Eckhart

 - Peter in GMAG: "What is the sin of the world?"
    - There is no such thing as sin...rather you yourselves are what produces sin when you act in accordance with the nature of adultery.
    - Julain of Nwich: 
       - "I did not see sin, for I beleive it has no kind of substance, no share in being, nor can it be recognized except by the pain caused by it."
       - "No wrath in God"

### Magdalene Anointing

 - Bruce Chilton conflates Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalene

 - Jesus and Mary shared a common ministry of ritual anointing

 - Chilton implies that Jesus learned about this Hellenic and Jewish _shamanic_ tradition of anointing from Mary

 - Jesus anoints a blind man. Chilton: "A record of the magic dimensions of his practice"

 - Mary of Bethany anoints Jesus with expensive perfue, _bought for his burial_

 - In JN, MAG asks the gardener for Jesus's body because she wants to anoint him

### Love as Strong as Death

 - Song of Songs --- John 21

 - Account of MAry and Jesus in garden oozes with nuptial references

 - and man and woman in eden

 - The Song of Songs should be read as the soundtrack to the Garden scene

 - We can imagine MAG saying: "All night I lay on my bed; I search for the one my heart lvoes... for love is as strong as death, its fire a mighty flame. Watrs cannot quench love"

 - Cynthia Bourgeault (READ HER STUFF)

### MAG and THOMAS

 - Do not touch me.
 - Touch me.

 - to Mag: "Go to my brothers..."
    - Jsus is telling Mary that if she wants to touch the Body of Christ, she is now invited to do so among the community of believers, which, after Easter, is the body of christ.

 - This is why it makes sense for Jesus to invite Thomas to rummage through the his flesh in 20:27, because he is amongst the believers.

 - "The great Western heresy --- is that we can be saved as individuals, that any of us alone can be in right relationshop with God... that indiviualist focus is idolatry" --- KJS, PB of TEC

 - A personal relationship with Christ is immensely important, but if we want to delve deep into the Body of Christ we are invited to do so within the community

 - JN20 invites us to encounter the face of Christ among those with whom we serve and worship

 - JN20 invites us to experience the Body of Christ sensually in the Eucharist when taste and gigest his flesh

 - MAG invites us to continue in the MAG-inspited ministry of anointing one another

 - MAG invites us to not only believe in the healing power of anointing, but also in its power to help us see Christ (The Anointed One) in each other

 - MAG invites us to participate in what English mystic Caryll Houselander calls "the Christing of the World"

 - The mother of female mysitcs arouses the followers of Christ today to reevaluate the relationship between sexuality and spirituality ...
    - ...to recover the ancient healing power of sacramental anointing
    - ...

 - Ultimately, this mystic seems to suggest that the goal of all visionary experiences, no matter how spicy or sexy they may be, is to bring us deeper into love with each other as we are blessed and anointed by  the Christ who surrounds us in the beloved community.

I have been involved in a number of parish and church communities that have worked together to write a "mission statement." 

Every time, I had a problem with the notion that _this_ particular church community had a specific or particular mission that needed to be formulated by committee and agreed upon by everyone.

Rather, I think the mission of every church community is that given to us by Christ:

> Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. 
> --- Matthew 28: 19-20

How we go about doing that, in what contexts, with what people, and so forth, varies tremendously from community to community, and also within a specific community over time. Different people within a single church community may pursue that mission individually in different ways.

The church has one mission --- to make disciples, to baptize, and to teach the commandments of Christ. 

But to what end? 

To put it another way, our mission is to proclaim that the Kingdom of God is at hand, and by proclaiming it, to make that "Kingdom come on Earth as it is in Heaven."

Stated this way, it is clear that our mission begins with the activity of God, who alone draws all people to Himself.

Top of class digression: 

The U.S. has broken more treaties than any other nations, mostly with Native Americans.

Manifest destiny.

John Edwards --- City on a Hill

 - (White) Americans are the new chosen people
 - Left persecution
 - Crossed the sea, miraculously
 - Arrived at promised land
 - Drive out the tribal people in the land

Encounter between Anglicans and indigenous people has always taken place in a colonial context.

Colonialism always includes an issue of land occupation.

Anglicanism in North American arrives with the very first colonists.

Charter of Virginia Company gives the rights to a huge amount of land, and the people, to the VCo. The charter says that they are responsible for the evangelization of the natives. CofE wanted to make the native Anglican, because they were subjects of the King.

Evangelization included "civilizing" them. 

It wasn't until the evangelical movement that Anglicans were especially interested in saving souls.

Early 19th century --- Jefferson signs Louisiana purchase, doubling size of US.

1849 --- Mexican War, US takes what is now Texas, etc.

US keeps making treaties with natives, keeps breaking them, as US moves further and further West.

Church tries to be peacemakers, but end up colluding with government.

 - Tries to persuade not to massacre
 - Tries to persuade natives to be content with reservations
 - Indian schools --- destroy Indian culture

"Gradual Civilization Act"

Government divvies up the Natives people, giving different denominations responsibility for working with divers geographical areas.

Often, the missionaries themselves were faithful, caring people who developed long-term, dedicated relationships with the people they were evangelizing. Many times they became strong advocates for the native people. --- That being said, they mostly did not question the government's ultimate goals of pacification and expansion.

1890s --- Episcopal mission work with Navajo. Hospital at Fort Defiance created and supported by the Women's Auxiliary. 

1976 --- Established a non-geographical diocese, the Diocese of Navajoland. 1990, first Navajo Bishop. (Graduate of CDSP.)


Towards the end of the 1990s, the Episcopal Church started to critically examine its colonial past.

Hawaii

Europeans first encountered Hawaiian islands with Capt. Cook. 

By 1810 there was a united kingdom in Hawaii. King asked CofE to send missionaries. Church said No.

English business interests, and some government officials, became part of Hawaiian royal structure.

Congregationalists are first missionaries.

Scottish Anglo-Catholic priest in late 1800s becomes advisor to royal court. 

Kamehameha IV becomes Anglican ("The Hawaiian Reformed Catholic Church") after visit to England.

Second Bishop of Hawaii asserts that they are an autonomous church.

Hawaiian people see Anglicanism as especially well-suited to Hawaii.

In 1890s, a cadre of wealthy businessmen, backed by the U.S., overthrew the Hawaiian royal government.

Native Spirituality

Tends to be oral and narrative.

Tends to be centered on land.


How to incorporate native spirituality into Anglicanism?

(AW: Also --- does this question matter when working in non-native environments?)

## Love and Charcoal Fire

 - Simon Peter represents disciples who abandon Jesus

 - "It was cold."... Charcoal fire.

 - Smell of charcoal fire.

 - SP feels ashamed for someone he loved.

 - Risen Christ does not even bring this up to Peter.

 - JEsus feeds him.

 - AT A CHARCOAL FIRE

 - Do you love me?

 - "Do you _agapein_ me?" "I _philein_ you." --- Jesus switches to _philein_ the last time.
    - Jesus is willing to meet Peter on his level, while calling him to a deeper love.

 - Jesus calls Peter to be a shepherd, as Jesus is a shepherd. Which means being wiling to lay down his life.

 - "You will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten a belt around you where you and take you where you do not wish to go."

### Return of the Green Eyed Monster

 - The final verses of the epilog attempt to make sense of the death of the BD

 - The last verses also function as one final invitation to stop comparing ourselves to others, to beware of the green eyed monster.

 - Peter has just been told to imitate Jesus.
    - "What about this guy?"

 - Rivalrous tensions between Peter and BD may reflect tensions between their followers in an early church...

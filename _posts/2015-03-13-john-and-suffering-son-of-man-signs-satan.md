## Prelude

Wisdom in Ecclesiastes

## John 2: Wine and Psalm 69


 - So far, Jesus has been portrayed as:
    - Logos (outcast)
    - Light (that enlightens all)
    - Passover Lamb
    - Son of Man
    - Target of Nathaniel's prejudice
    - Willing to take our blame (lamb) and reveal our compulsion to blame (light)

### Cana Wedding

 - At Cana wedding, the wine gives out --- who is to blame? 
 - What is that to me and you, madam?
    - "Why are you blaming me for this? This is not y problem."
    - If Jesus is divine, then it makes sense to ask him for help
    - common pattern: request --- rebuff --- persistence --- action
 - In his own time, he takes action
 - This is the first sign

#### Meaning of the Sign

 - Jesus replacing Dionysus?
    - Water into wine
    - Feast in early January
 - Jesus fulfilling  Jewish purity rites
 - Jesus celebrating life? wedding feast instead of desert fast
    - Kingdom of God as a banquet
    - John Kater's preferred reading (?)
 - Jesus revealing his glory and his disciples come to believe
    - Third day of the wedding feast
 - Seventh Day --- New Eve, New Adam --- Church Father's reading

### Up to Jerusalem for Passover

 - Jesus and thousands of othe Jews go up to Jerusalem for Passover (one of the Shalosh Regalim)

 - They purcahse a lamb without blemish to be sacrificed

 - The blood og the lamb would be hurled on the altar (where the Abraham/Isaac story) and then roasted

 - In order to purchasr the lamb, Jewish pilgrims needed to exchange pagan money into kosher money

 - Jesus overturns the Temples

#### Meaning of the act

 - Criticizing temple authorities for coop with Rome
 
 - Asserting his role and identity as new Temple
 
 - Foreshadowing temple destruction
 
 - Expressing anger at moeny changers for charging exorbitant rates to poor
 
 - Aligning himself with prophet's critique of sacrificial system
    - I desire mercy not sacrifice
    - Isaiah 1:11-13

> What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the Lord;  
> I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts;  
> I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats.  
> When you come to appear before me, who asked this from your hand?  
> Trample my courts no more; bringing offerings is futile; incense is an abomination to me.  

#### Psalm 69

 - After the death and resurrection, the disciples understood this event in light of the Psalm 69

> It is for your sake that I have borne reproach, that shame has covered my face.  
> I have become a stranger to my kindred, an alien to my motherâ€™s children.  
> It is zeal for your house that has consumed me; the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.
> --- Ps 69: 7-8

 - Most commentators: my zeal causes me to do this.

 - Girardian reading: zeal of Jesus that is going to get him killed.
    - This is what the Psalm is saying.

## John 3: Snakes the Green-eyed monster

> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so must the son of man be lifted up.  
> - Jn 3:14

 - Numbers 21
    - Israelites complain
    - Snakes show up and poison Israelites
    - Israelites ask Moses to ask God to send away the snakes
    - Snakes are interpreted as a sign of God's wrath
    - Moses lifts up the image of the snake in the wilderness

 - Transforms the symbol that represents God's wrath into a sign of haling and new life.
 - God did not come into the world to condemn the world, etc...
 - John transforms a symbol of human violence into a symbol of healing and new life
 - By turning this symbol back into a symbol of bloodthirsty wrath, we miss the point (atonement as substitution for God's wrath) --- 
    - Anselm, Luther,Calvin, Charles Hodge
    - Penal substitution

### JBap losing numbers to Jesus

 - JBap's disciples see Jesus as a rival

> O, beware my lord, of jealousy. It is the green eyed monster that doth mock the meat it feeds on.  
> --- Iago, Othello

 - JBap's disciples are playing with satanic fire
 - The green-eyed monster sets in motion the levers and pulleys of the vilent scapegoat mecanism
 - JBAP does not bite: he responds:

> No one can receive anything except what has been given from heaven.

 - Friendship involved sympathetic joy (no schadenfreude)
 - A wonderful liturgical symbol of sympathetic joy is the Best Man at a wedding.
    - finds joy fulfilled as he decreases while the bridegroom increases and receives his bride

> John and Jesus are twinlike, but the y eschew the satanic temptation to compete.  
> --- Ann Astell, Sacrifice, Scripture, and Substitution


## John 4: Woman at the Well

 - Jesus speaks to a Samaritan woman, which is scandalous because:
    - Woman
    - Samaritan

### Samaritans

 - 723 BC Sargon the Great destroyed Samaria
 - Foreigners move in
    - Babylon
    - Cuth
    - Hamath
    - Avvites
    - Sepharvites
 - Syrian King Antiochus Epiphanes addeds a Temple to Zeus on Mt Gerazim
 - Five Gods, and another
 - You have had five husbands, and the one you have now is not your husband

### Samaritan Woman

 - immoral woman trying to change the subject
 - loose woman trying to seduce Jesus
 - Orthodox --- St. Photini
 - representative
 - Schneiders: 
    - "most theologically sophisticated interlocutor of Jesus"
    - "most likely candidate for the evangelists' textual alter ego"
    - *Because of the woman's testimony*

 - If the Samaritan woman _did_ have five husbands, this would _not_ be a sign that she was loose and immoral
 - Likely a victim of society
    - Divorce was man's prerogative
    - Being childless was grounds for divorce
    - Possibly widowed
    - Went to well at noon alone to avoid other women who would have seen her childless state as a punishment from God

 - Jesus is reaching out to someone who has been:
    - pushed around by men
    - belittled by Jews
    - victimized by society
    - scorned by other women
    - excluded woman who is representative to a community of exclusion
       - excluded by the excluded

 - There is something undeniably sexual about this episode about this episode, and the Fourth Gospel as a whole
    - Several references to weddings
    - the well is charged with sexual energy
    - Jesus the Bridegroom will take Samaria as Bride
    - Jesus reveals his Messianic identity to the woman
    - Nourished and inspired by the conversation, she shares her testimony

## John 4: Second Sign at Cana

> Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
> --- Jn 4:44

 - Request
 - Rebuff
 - Persistence
 - Instruction
 - Obedience
 - Sign
 - Faith

## John 5

 - Healing at Fountain of Bethesda
 - "House of Healing" --- "House of Shame"

> See I have made you well! Do not sin any more, so that nothing worse happens to you."

> Do you want to be made well?

 - Health and wholeness
 - Hygeia (hygene) snake and water jar

> Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; and while I am making my way, someone else steps down ahead of me.

 - blames others

AW:
 Compare to learned helplessness of poverty and concerns about social justice and equality. Are the other people trying to get well _oppressing_ him?

 - Jesus responds by telling him to take action
 - Man chooses health

 - Is healed man's sin connected to his propensity to blame others, including Jesus.

 - Does the healed men eventually move out of his blame-bound existence

> The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who made him well. Therefore the Jews started persecuting Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.

 - Jesus's response:

> My Father is still working, and I also am working.  
> --- jn 5:17

> God never ceases from making something... as it is the property of fire to burn, and of snow to chill, so also it is the property of God to be creating.
>  --- Philo

 - We are thus invited to become co-creators with God, __participating__ in our own creation

AW:
 Three perfections.

Gregory of Nyssa: epecktasis
 - moving further and further into the infinite love of God

## John 6: The bread of the high priest

 - Jesus tests Philip: Where are we to buy bread for these people to eat?
 - Jesus knows that his disciples wil lbe expected to bear the responsibility of people's needs and desires an sometimes have to bear the blame when expectations are not met
    - "We need someone to blame."
 - How are you going to respond when people expect you to do the impossible?
    - Are you ready to take the blame for 5000 hungry people.

> Six months wages would not be enough for each to get a little."

 - No response.

 - Andrew: Five loaves and two fish. What are these among so many?
    - NOW Jesus responds.

> The need of the world is not too great for out resources if it is the Lord who directs the use of those resources.  
> --- William Temple, St. John 73

 - Feeding of the 5000 is the fourth sign
 - What is the spiritual significance of this bread?

### BREAD

 - In the first temple, the priests are the Bread of the Presence
 - On the sabbath, twelve loaves made of fine flour were placed int he temple
 - The bread serve as a sign of the eternal covenant, and nourished the priests with **Wisdom**.

 - Come eat of my bread, and drink of thewine I have mixed. - Proverbs 9:6
 - She will feed him with the bread of understanding. - Sirach

 - On the day of atonement the royal high priest (through substitution) offered his blood to cleanse the temple and thus to heal the creation that it represented.

 - By feeding the 5000, Jesus is doing more than satisfying their hunger. He is treating them ll like High Priests.
 - "You are ALL high priests now. You are called to give your life, your blood, to heal creation. The bread enlightens and empowers you to participate in the healing of creation and self-giving love."

 - Jesus is ordaining everyone.

 - Walks on water --- Exodus

 - Jesus embodies a movement and liberation from blame to abundant life
 - The following discourse on the Bread of Life elucidates how that movement can be made
 - Jesus offers himself as the self-giving high priest in order to nourish and make other self-giving high priests

Sidebar: beeswax candles absorb toxin and emit love

> Do not complain amongst yourselves.

 - Numbers 14:2, Exodus 16:2
 -Jesus is trying to raise up a people who can be on the receiving end of the grumbling, complaining and blaming and transform the world through their creative forgiveness.
 - Jesus knows this is difficult and offers his disciples an out:
    - Do you wish to leave?

> Lord, to whom can we go? You have the words of eternal life.
> --- Jn 6:68

## John 7: Vulnerable to Victimhood

 - Brothers tell him to go to Jerusalem
 - He says he isn't going
 - He goes.

Sidebar: compare jn 7 to sermon on the mount

 - Nicodemus whoapproaches Jesus in the night in John 3, now defends Jesus.

> Our law does not judge people without first giving them a hearing to find out what they are doing.

 - Nicodemus understands the Torah as a safeguard against victimization
 - What happens when you stand up for victims?

> Are you  Gallilean too?


>The key feature of blessedness is that it involves living a deliberately chosen and cultivated sort of life which makes the ones living it immensely vulnerable to becoming victims.
--- James Allison

> He will make glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. People who walked in darkness have seen a great light.
Isaiah 9:1-2

 - I am the lgiht of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.

 - 8:1-11 --- woman caught in adultery is missing from ancient manuscripts

 - reference from "Nothing good from galilee" is followed by Jesus "light of the world"


## John 8: The Devil and Daniel (Webster)

re:
 - Daniel in Susanah 

 - The Devil can be understood as
    - the satan (accuser)
    - personification of the lynch mob
    - the interrelated phenomenon of envy, rivalry, and lynching
 - The Devil can also be understood as
    - Those who are accused and demonized
 - Daniel --- the paraclete / advocate --- discerns between the real Devil (satan) and the demonized victim
 - Daniel AND Nicodemus see Torah as a safeguard against exclusion
 - Scribes and Pharisees see it as a means for excluding

 - Parts of the Torah can be seen this way
    - Adultery --- death

 - BUT --- protection against 

 - Ritual of Bitter Water
    - Priest pours water in clay jar with dust and sprinkles  
    - curses written on parchment, in ink which has to be soluble in water
    - woman drinks water
    - trial by ordeal
 - Jesus writes on the ground, which will be washed away by the wind (connection of wind and water --- holy spirit, baptism)

 - What did Jesus write on the ground?

 - Susanna

 - Later in 8, Jesus is the one who is accused
 - He has to be his own advocate
 - Jews accuse him of being an illegitimate child, Mary is a loose woman, he is a bastard

> This is no gentle

>You are from your father the devil, and you choose to do your father's desires.

 - Reading this loaded statement in light of accusational mob.

 - When Christians accuse Hews of being devils, they are on the side of Satan, just like the satanic Judeans in Jn 8.
